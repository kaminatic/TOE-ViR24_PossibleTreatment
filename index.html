    <p class="roboto-mono-medium">
        Most worryingly, no consistent means of treatment have been found to combat the spread of TOE-ViR29. In a similar way to how a cure for the common cold is still elusive, and how a definitive cure for COVID-19 will most likely remain out of reach due to the highly mutative nature, experts speculate that the many strains of TOE-ViR24 will eventually become endemic. As such, vaccinations for TOE-ViR24 have been considered ineffectual. The most effective measures to increase one’s resistance to TOE-ViR24 are changes in one’s social environments and one’s own responsibility in staying informed as to where certain strains of TOE-ViR24 come from and how one relates themselves to them. As different strains of TOE-ViR24 pass through populations, individual hosts will develop antibodies to its influence in due time, but when exposed to sufficiently altered strains of TOE-ViR24, might still show symptoms ranging in severity. In the end, it will be a matter of consensus between various parties, including governments and academic communities, as to which strains of TOE-ViR24 are considered safe, and which strains are considered harmful and thus need active intervention to keep under control.  </p>
